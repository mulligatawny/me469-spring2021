 - support CVFEM, EBVC, FEM
 - promote simple elements to higher order

high level CVFEM:
 - a hybrid method
 - in-between FEM (underlying basis that can be promoted) & FVM (conservative since flux leaving one face matches the one entering the other)
 
sliding and overset meshing available

NALU ABSTRACTIONS:-------------------------------------------------------------

1. A time integrator wrapping non-linear coupling between different physics sets (realms = physics equations + BCs), all of which are coupled using operator-split (or even monolithic, which methods. 

Consider CHT: we have a continuity, momentum and energy equation in the fluids zone, and a diffusion equation in the solid. We could solve this fully coupled (monolithic). In segregated systems, you have two separate systems (fluid and thermal) + interfaces (continuity of flux at these), and iterate to repair the coupling.

2. Input file:

linear_solvers: -> Trilinos-based pre-conditioning and sparse solvers
transfers: -> multi-physics/zone coupling

YAML: creates a database of the options from the IP file, and Nalu "pulls" from the database.

3. Divergence:

(i) NaNs in the linear or non-linear solver, typically.

Typical causes: bad ICs, large timestep, bad stabilization (central operators w/o upwinding), poor time integration (II order timestep + adaptive ts?).
